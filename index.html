        <h2> Ludwig van Beethoven </h2>
          <p> Ludwig van Beethoven (December 1770 - March 26, 1827) was a phenomenal German composer from the Classical Era and the beginning of the Romantic Era. Widely considered the greatest composer of all time, Beethoven wrote many masterpieces although most of them weren't performed frequently until after his passing. The man was famous for his nine symphonies, his 32 piano sonatas, and his five piano concertos. Even though Beethoven possessed incredible musical ability he did however, suffer in the love department. Beethoven fell in love with and proposed to many women but tragically remained a bachelor for his entire life. This influenced him emotionally, mentally, and had a huge effect on his composition output. However, Beethoven was not just unlucky in love, he was also unlucky health-wise. Later in life, the brilliant composer lost his hearing. Surprisingly, this did not hinder Beethoven's output and instead spurred him on to create more masterpieces.</p>
